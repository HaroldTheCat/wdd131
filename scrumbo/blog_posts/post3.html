<body> <h1>Open Reel Ensemble: Skip the middle man your instrument is the music player</h1>
    <p>if you even understand what reel-to-reels are you will still be confused when you learn about</p>
        <h3>Open Reel Ensemble</h3>
        <p>In a brief and circumstantial summary of what a reel-to-reel is. It is a music player, not an instrument.
            Lucky for me they chose to ignore that memo.
            Open Reel Ensemble is a japanese group that perform music by manipulating the reels of magnetic tape on their reel-to-reel tape recorders.</p>
            <p>Which I find amazing because I struggle to get mine to function on the best of days.</p>

            <p>Last time I got it to run, it played the beach-boys very poorly.
                So believe me when I say I am extremely impressed by the sound variety and quality of the music they were able to get into their 13 albums of work.</p>
                <blockquote>it’s not cyberpunk or steampunk.
                    “magnetic punk”.
                    
                    -A quote from their latest album “Magnetic Phunk” description</blockquote>
                    <p>Their newest album "Magnetic Phunk" is framed that an Martian Invasion of earth is happening and they are defeating them peacefully with the power of Magnetic Waves.

                        Oh boy you had me on using reel-to-reels like turntables and drums. Just the creative energy needed to come up with this concept is enough to make me want to buy this. 
                        
                        Even if I mourn the amount of Magnetic recording tape used, that stuff is expensive, and I am surprised that it is stilling made. Though I am extremely glad it is.
                        
                        Their sound reminds me oddly enough of less pop influenced Jet-Set-Radio. 
                        
                        Their sound focuses on a Funky beat, and uses distortions of voices and other recordings to give the music a distorted remix vibes from the slowing and speeding up of the tape.It also has an oddly retro-futurist vibe to it from the medium they are playing on because it was invented in the 1920's. 
                        
                        Their music sounds old because it is being played of an old technology.
                        
                        This three track album comes with the "how was it done?" mystery that comes from their unique and un-replicable style and process. 
                        
                        I at least haven't heard of any competing reel-to-reel players.
                        
                        And can I say the mystery got me? They sell a digital book with their album on the process of playing their instruments and how they came about making their album, interviews and illustrations.
                        
                        Their music is good, don't get me wrong. I like their music, but I need to know how they did their music, and why.
                        
                        If you want something different, if you want something you never even thought about happening, something so utterly out of left field, and has a familiar funky beat.
                        
                        You can't go wrong with "Magnetic Phunk" by Open Reel Ensemble.</p>
