    <h1>Pizza Hotline: ”level select”; The Year 2000 and me</h1>
    <p>Hey. Yeah you. Have you heard of something called…</p>
    <h2>Y2K</h2>
    <p>I say that because man, you know what I was doing in the year 2000? Learning my fine motor skills, because I was one year old.
        needless to say I was not up and hip in the trends of the time at the time.
        Which is why it is weird for me to be so into the vibe that that millennium year put out, or I least think it put out.
        There has been a lot of retrospectives that have no doubt influenced my opinion on the timeframe.
        Not to mention my parents lack of influence, they have not been in the main stream culture since the 80s.
        Though it is weird to think my entire life struggle with understanding modernity comes from my parents buying a computer, learning that they had the wrong modem, and then deciding this computer technology thing was not worth the effort.
        I never knew many of the y2k staples existed until much, much later in life.
        Which is a weird and round about way of segueing into an artist I surprisingly know very little about. He seams to be a fellow from the UK. That makes music. Not that I am complaining. He makes some great music that contain a vibe.</p>
        <blockquote>"liquid soaked low-poly 3d dreamscapes. strictly no save states. select your level. plug in and begin dreaming. 
            inspired by y2k video game aesthetics and soundtracks 
            ps1 // ps2 // n64 // saturn // dreamcast //" 
            -From the album descriptor section</blockquote>
            <p>Pizza Hotline’s level select is an album to chill to if you enjoy or feel like you would enjoy that time where Sega was still making consoles. That time Sony was just starting their long lasting series which their consoles would be known for.
                Pizza Hotline distilled the gaming scene of the 2000s and more importantly its audio into a pleasant album. The album cares about its inspirations, this is no more apparent than my favorite track “Shadow Mosses”
                The track comes from the original “Metal Gear Solid” which I oddly enough have right next to me right now.</p>

                <p>He did not remake the track to remind you of the original song, he made the track to remind you how you felt playing the game as a child. This reality that he composes in the album is the nostalgic feelings of when consoles and video games were becoming 3d.
                    The album overall recalls and recants the digitally mystical sounds of the booting up of a ps1, ps2, or dreamcast. Their otherworldly and experimental nature of their products coating their rough digital landscape.
                    I at least think they are magical.
                    If you hold your memories of 2000s gaming close to your heart or want to bask in the relaxing upbeat tunes of a bygone era of early 3d gaming. Check out Pizza Hotlines “Level Select”.
                    or at least look at the album art. I think it looks neat.</p>
