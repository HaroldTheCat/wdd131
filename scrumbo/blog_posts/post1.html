    <h2>The Second Best Detective; Frog Detective</h2>
    <p>Frog Detective is the world’s second-best detective.
        Out of all three of his cases, Frog Detective has never failed one. With his essential magnifying glass and legendary deduction skills, it is no surprise that he is the second-best.</p>

        <p> The world is better because of Frog Detective and his blog. I wish I had half the style that Frog Detective’s blog has. 
            Besides his legendary skills and exciting fan base, Frog Detective is a fantastic character. His three games are outstanding examples of simple writing and innocent deadpan humor. 
            It is just a delight to read and play. 
            There is a childlike innocence mixed with a focus, a wink, and a suggestion that we should perhaps live a bit more like these characters, who know that crime does not exist because that would mean they would label someone as a criminal. 
            If they did that, they would have to be put into jail, which is a bad idea because that means they would have no way to fix their mistakes and give back to society. </p>
            <blockquote>“You are not going to jail; jail isn’t real, but you should probably apologize.”

            <p> For all my #deep thoughts on a game about a frog solving mysteries titled “The Haunted Island,” “The Invisible Wizard,” and “Corruption at Cowboy County,” they are very.... I almost don’t want to mention any of them because I was hoping you could learn about them, yourself, the games are only five dollars each. That is like a fast food order. 
                It is just so pleasant. I want more media that is calmer and more entertaining, like this. A good sense of humor holds up a sustainable game model; the developers spent much more time on the writing and feel of these games than on gameplay or graphics.</p>
                <p> The above paragraph is a vast oversimplification and just an opinion. Not all games can be like this charming point-and-click adventure-esk game. No matter how much I like them. </p>
                <p> You should consider how games, like writing, can be so drastically different from one another. How games can be experienced. Not just played. 
                    I liked it so much that I bought merchandise from the series, including a notebook with stickers. It was lost in the mail, but that is life. 
                    So, why am I writing this blog post? Simply put, I love the game. It’s fun to write, and its unique storytelling ideas have captured my imagination. 
                    Hey, everyone needs inspiration</p>
