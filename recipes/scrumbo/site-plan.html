			<p>Welcome to my Neo-City! I have been sitting on the idea of writing a site but did not know that there was a successor to the Geo-City I was familiar with.

				Hi I am Douglas, the Cat is Harold, and the Beetle is Sip. I tend to make tiny characters and call them Scrumbos. I think cute little Scrumbos make the world a better place so I try and make media that will uplift those who are willing to give it a chance.

				That being said, I am full of joy for many things; it won't always be Scrumbos (no matter how much we want it). This Neo-City will be full of many of my projects. These can be anything from solar panels to Robot vacuum cleaners. I enjoy many things quite a bit, so the content will shift quite a bit.</p>

			<h3> As stated above in the dynamic elements section I will be dynamicly importing blog post html on a click of these images. They are short essays and reviews, and would be to much to import into this work sheet. Here is the shortest one.
				<h2>the second best detective; frog detective</h2>
				<p>Tfrog Detective is the world’s second-best detective.
					Out of all three of his cases, Frog Detective has never failed one. With his essential magnifying glass and legendary deduction skills, it is no surprise that he is the second-best.</p>
					<p> The world is better because of Frog Detective and his blog. I wish I had half the style that Frog Detective’s blog has. 
						Besides his legendary skills and exciting fan base, Frog Detective is a fantastic character. His three games are outstanding examples of simple writing and innocent deadpan humor. 
						It is just a delight to read and play. 
						There is a childlike innocence mixed with a focus, a wink, and a suggestion that we should perhaps live a bit more like these characters, who know that crime does not exist because that would mean they would label someone as a criminal. 
						If they did that, they would have to be put into jail, which is a bad idea because that means they would have no way to fix their mistakes and give back to society. </p>
						<p> For all my #deep thoughts on a game about a frog solving mysteries titled “The Haunted Island,” “The Invisible Wizard,” and “Corruption at Cowboy County,” they are very I almost don’t want to mention any of them because I I almost don’t want to mention any of them because I was hoping you could learn about them; the games are only five dollars each. That is like a fast food order. 
							It is just so pleasant. I want more media that is calmer and more entertaining, like this. A good sense of humor holds up a sustainable game model; the developers spent much more time on the writing and feel of these games than on gameplay or graphics.</p>
							<p> The above paragraph is a vast oversimplification and just an opinion. Not all games can be like this charming point-and-click adventure-esk game. No matter how much I like them. </p>
							<p> You should consider how games, like writing, can be so drastically different from one another. How games can be experienced. Not just played. 
								I liked it so much that I bought merchandise from the series, including a notebook with stickers. It was lost in the mail, but that is life. 
								So, why am I writing this blog post? Simply put, I love the game. It’s fun to write, and its unique storytelling ideas have captured my imagination. 
								Hey, everyone needs inspiration</p>
			
				<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				This section will be resizable for smaller screens, causing the nav bar to fold in to a hamburger menu.
			</p>
			<img src="welcome.PNG" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
				This section will be resizable for smaller screens, causing the nav bar to fold in to a hamburger menu. The blog posts and images to click on for the blog posts will also go into one column and be dynamicly input by javascript.
